            Awesome teaching support from the TAs who did the bootcamp
            themselves.Getting guidance from them and learning from experiences
            was easy.

            The staff seem geniuenly concered about my progress which I find
            really refreshing.The programme gave me the confidence neccesarry to
            be able to go out in the world and present my self as a capable
            junior developer.The standard is above the rest.You will get the
            personal attention you need from incredible community of smart and
            amazing people.

            Such a life changing experience.Highly recommended! Before joining
            the camp I have never written a line of code Ineeded some structure
            from proffesionalsWho can help me learn programming step by step.i
            waas encouraged to enroll by a former student of the who can only
            say wonderfull things about the proggram.The entirecurriculum and
            staff did not dissapoint.Thesy were very hands-on and Inever had to
            wait long for assitance.The agile team project in particular it was
            outstanding .It took my learning to the next level in away that no
            tutoriol could ever have.Infact I've been refering to it during
            interviews as an example of my development experience.It certainly
            helped me land a job as afull-stack developer after recieving
            multiple offers.100%recommend"
